# Artist Statement

In my interactive AR experience, I invite viewers to immerse themselves in two dynamically contrasting environments: a lush rainforest and a bustling city intersection. This artwork, crafted with care and precision, aims to offer more than mere visual engagement; it seeks to evoke a deeper understanding and appreciation of our intricate relationship with both natural and urban environments.

As the creator, I envision viewers perceiving these scenes not just as backdrops but as living, interactive spaces that respond to their actions. In the rainforest, the sway of trees and the rhythm of rainfall change with user inputs, simulating the delicate balance of nature that reacts to even the smallest stimuli. In the city, the flow of traffic and the sounds of urban life adjust to the viewer's decisions, reflecting the hectic, interconnected systems that pulse through a city's veins.

Interaction is pivotal in my artwork. It transforms viewers from passive observers to active participants, enhancing their engagement and emotional investment in the scenes. By allowing them to control elements like the weather, traffic lights, or natural sounds, I aim to create a sense of agency and responsibility. This interaction highlights the impact of human actions on different environments, urging viewers to think about their role in both preserving and shaping the world around them.

Through this experience, I hope to inspire a nuanced reflection on how individual actions can influence and alter our surroundings. My goal is for viewers to leave with a heightened awareness and perhaps a newfound resolve to interact thoughtfully with both the natural world and urban landscapes in their daily lives.

In constructing this AR experience, I have endeavored to not only showcase technological artistry but also to provoke thought and evoke responsibilityâ€”a challenge that I have embraced with both passion and purpose.
