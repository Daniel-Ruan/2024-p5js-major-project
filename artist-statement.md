# Artist Statement

My interactive artwork explores the relationship between human gestures and environmental control through two contrasting scenes: a natural rainforest and an urban intersection. Through these scenes, I aim to demonstrate how modern technology can bridge the gap between human intention and environmental interaction.

I've designed three distinct interaction methods - traditional mouse/keyboard controls, hand gestures, and facial expressions through AR technology - to create an intuitive and immersive experience. In the rainforest scene, viewers can control natural elements like wind and rain using both keyboard commands and natural body movements. Opening their mouth wider creates heavier rain, while hand waves generate wind, creating a direct connection between human expression and natural phenomena. Additionally, viewers can interact with objects like coconuts, rocks, and puddles using either mouse clicks or hand gestures tracked by AR.

The urban scene presents a constructed environment where viewers can influence city life through traffic lights, vehicles, and natural elements like grass and flowers. The day-night cycle and traffic flow respond to viewer interactions, demonstrating how human intervention shapes urban environments. The AR interface allows viewers to trigger these interactions through natural gestures like nodding or pinching movements, making the experience more engaging and intuitive.

By incorporating AR technology alongside traditional controls, I want viewers to experience how different interaction methods can enhance our connection with both natural and urban environments. The black cursor, controlled by finger movements, serves as a visual bridge between physical gestures and digital responses. Through these varied interaction methods, I hope viewers will not only enjoy the playful aspects of environmental control but also reflect on how technology can create more natural and intuitive ways to interact with different environments.
