- ## General Instructions

  - **Welcome to my interactive artwork!**
  - **Press `H`** to toggle help text on or off.
  - **Click buttons or use keyboard shortcuts** to navigate through the artwork.
  - **Use LEFT/RIGHT ARROW KEYS** to switch between scenes.
  - **Press `W` or `UP ARROW`** to return to the main menu at any time.
  - **Press `R`** to reset the current scene to its initial state.
  - **Press `SPACEBAR`** to take a screenshot of the current scene.

  ## Rainforest Scene (Scene 1)

  - **Hold `A/D`** to create wind, influencing the movement of raindrops and leaves.
  - **Press `S`** to toggle the rain on or off.
  - **Press `Q/E`** to adjust the size of the raindrops, affecting the intensity of the rain.
  - Interactive objects such as coconuts, rocks, and puddles:
    - **Click or drag** rocks to throw them into puddles to create splashes or simulate a storm.
    - Raindrops and leaves are dynamically influenced by the wind direction, enhancing the realism of the scene.

  ## City Intersection Scene (Scene 2)

  - **Hold `S`** to reset the traffic lights, managing the flow of traffic.
  - Interactive objects:
    - **Click on cars or doors** to honk the horns.
    - **Click on streetlights or traffic lights** to turn them on or off.
    - **Interact with the fire hydrant** to water the grass or pretend to direct traffic as a cop.
    - The traffic lights control the flow of cars and, indirectly, pedestrian movement; cars stop at red lights, allowing an implied safe passage for pedestrians.

  ## Artwork Complexity and Additional Information

  - This artwork is primarily rendered using p5.js, which contributes to the lengthy nature of the code files due to the complex interactions and dynamic elements across different scenes.

## Future and Prospects

In the future, I plan to continue my deep dive into AR technology and its application in interactive art. My initial intention is to enhance the interactivity between users and artistic works through AR, moving beyond passive viewing to enable genuine interaction through user movements affecting the artwork.

Although this project did not fully realize the envisioned AR interactivity due to underestimation of time and challenging technical issues, I view these challenges as valuable learning experiences that enrich my future work. Particularly, solving problems related to ml5.js and experimenting with facial and hand tracking have broadened my knowledge in machine learning and image processing.

Going forward, I aim to overcome the technical hurdles encountered and fully integrate AR interactive features into my artworks. Additionally, I plan to explore further possibilities in augmented reality, such as incorporating dynamic physical elements or creating more naturally interactive environments for users.

For those interested in exploring more, I have prepared an AR demo. This demo utilizes your camera in full-screen mode to capture facial and hand movements, enabling simple interactions through gesture recognition. To run this demo, please change the filename in the `<script src="sketch.js"></script>` tag from `sketch` to `sketch-ARtest` in the index.html file. Although this demo is not part of the main project, it offers a glimpse into potential future developments and showcases my initial forays into the field of AR.
